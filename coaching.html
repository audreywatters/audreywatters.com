<p>ChatGPT churns out a coaching bio that looks like this: <em> &quot;[Your Name] is a highly experienced and dedicated coach with a passion for helping individuals achieve their full potential. With [number] years of coaching experience, [Your Name] has worked with a diverse range of clients, from athletes to professionals, helping them overcome obstacles and reach their goals.

<p>It's dull and uninspiring — words strung all together neatly but actually meaning nothing. And somehow it's supposed to be the future. We're being sold the promise that our health is bound up in our adoption of various health and fitness gadgetry. We're told this is "personalization," but it's nothing of the sort. It's just a shinier template that we're supposed to wedge our bodies into.</p>

<p>But <em>you</em> — you've clicked on the &quot;Coaching&quot; tab on my website because you're looking for a human to work with, not a machine. You'd like to learn and grow without handing over your data and the direction of your change to an app or to an algorithm.</p>

<p>I can help you think through and move through life — particularly if you're a new and/or an aging athlete, particularly if you're a writer (or other creative type).</p>

<p>I'm available for online consultations and, if you live in New York City, in-person sessions. I can talk you through your fitness goals (and your writing and reading and thinking goals). I can help you devise with a training regimen, whether you're preparing for a race or for the heavy shit we all have to lift as we move through life. <a href="mailto:audrey.watters@gmail.com">Shoot me an email</a>, and let's chat.</p>
