<h2>Full Disclosure...</h2>
</br />

<p>I am always suspicious when I hear people invoke &#8220;objectivity&#8221; &#8211; whether they&#8217;re scientists or journalists or teachers. I am deeply implicated &#8211; me, Audrey &#8211; in all I write, in all I think. I try my best to be transparent about that. So here&#8217;s some things that situate my knowledge (and for you, dear reader, to situate me in turn):</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<br />
<p>I went to public school in Wyoming through 11th grade when I was sent to a <a href="http://www.stclares.ac.uk/">private boarding school</a> in Oxford, England. (My dad&#8217;s from Wyoming; my mum&#8217;s from England.) I did not graduate from a US high school. (The State of Wyoming would not grant me my diploma as I didn&#8217;t have enough PE credits.) I have an International Baccalaureate instead. The IB was the best education I received in my entire educational career: from kindergarten through graduate school. I recognize the privilege of private school.</p>

<p>I dropped out of college when I was 19. I had a baby when I was 21. I went back to school eventually (mostly taking undergraduate classes via &#8220;distance education&#8221;) and stayed there for multiple degrees. I was widowed when I was 34. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/08/29/the-real-reason-i-dropped-out-of-a-phd-program/">I dropped out of a PhD program a year later</a></a>.</p>

<p>I taught university for almost 10 years, teaching a variety of classes in a number of departments: composition, Folklore, Women&#8217;s Studies, English, Film, Comparative Literature. During that time, I was a member of the <a href="http://gtff.net/">Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation</a>, the labor union representing the University of Oregon graduate students and a local of the American Federation of Teachers. I am no longer a member of either union, as I&#8217;m no longer a grad student.</p>

<p>I wrote my Masters Thesis in Folklore on political pranks. It included a chapter on political pie-throwing, and at one time I was known as the scholarly expert on this act. (I have an autographed copy of NoÃ«l Godin&#8217;s book, and no, I will never take or receive Bill Gates&#8217; money.)</p>

<p>I worked for the <a href="http://iste.org/">International Society for Technology in Education</a> (ISTE) for (not quite) two years before resigning to become a freelance writer. I have no financial interest in the organization and am not a member.</p>

<p>I have a 25-year-old son who&#8217;s opted not to finish college. I don&#8217;t believe that everyone should have to go to college; I think that times are incredibly tough for those who don&#8217;t. (That&#8217;s not a new thing; that&#8217;s sorta always been the point, right?)</p>

<h3>Economics</h3>
<br />
<p>I have freelanced for various publications, including The Baffler, The Atlantic, Educating Modern Learners, KQED&#8217;s MindShift, Inside Higher Ed, and The School Library Journal.</p>

<p>Mostly I write for my own ed-tech blog <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>. I refuse to run ads or take sponsorship dollars. Instead, the site is funded <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/support/">by readers&#8217; donations</a>.</p>

<p>Although I&#8217;ve also done some <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com">research</a> to pay my bills, I tend to do quite a bit of <a href="http://speaking.hackeducation.com">speaking</a>, and that is my main source of income. I don&#8217;t do consulting. <a href="http://audreywatters.com/faq/">So don&#8217;t ask</a>.</p>

<p>I was a recipient of the <a href="https://journalism.columbia.edu/spencer-education-fellowship">Spencer Education Journalism Fellowship</a> for the 2017&#8211;2018 academic year. I was a recipient of a <a href="https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/flash-grants/">Shuttleworth Foundation Flash Grant</a> in 2014.</p>

<p>I currently have a book contract with MIT Press for <em>Teaching Machines</em>.</p>

<p>When my dad died a few years ago, I inherited enough money to pay off my student loans (about $20,000 from grad school). I also inherited a stake in some empty commercial lots in Casper, Wyoming that I should probably sell before it&#8217;s time to pay property taxes on that crap again. I also inherited an IRA (about $3000), which I really need to deal with as my dad had a real terrible politics of investing.</p>

<p>My husband <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> is also a technology professional, and we&#8217;ve started a business (and <a href="http://podcast.contrafabulists.com">a podcast</a>) together called <a href="http://contrafabulists.com">Contrafabulists</a>. As the name perhaps suggests, we are interested in giving the stories told by the tech industry some well-deserved critical scrutiny. Kin works for F5 Networks in Seattle, where both of us have resided since January 2019.</p>
