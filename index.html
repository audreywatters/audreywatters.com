<p>I am an education writer, an independent scholar, a serial dropout, a rabble-rouser, and ed-tech's Cassandra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; I often say. You can catch snippets of it, if you pay attention. I&rsquo;ve got a&nbsp;<a href="http://audreywatters.com/cv/cv.html">CV</a>&nbsp;if you care about such formalities.</p>

<p>I love science fiction, tattoos, and, some days, computer technologies. I loathe mushy foods and romantic comedies. I&rsquo;m not ashamed to admit I like ABBA and dislike Tolkien. I am somewhat ashamed to admit I&rsquo;ve not finished <em>Ulysses</em>, and I've never even started <em>Infinite Jest</em>. I prefer cake to pie, unless we're talking pastry projectiles. I pick fights on the Internet. I&rsquo;m a high school dropout and a PhD dropout. I have a Master's degree in Folklore and was once considered the academic expert on political pie-throwing. I was (I am?) a widow. I'm a mom. I have a hard stare that I like to imagine is much like Paddington Bear&rsquo;s and a smirk much like the Cheshire Cat&rsquo;s. I am not afraid.</p>

<p>I travel as much as I possibly can. &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; at least according to my driver&rsquo;s license, is Hermosa Beach, California.</p>

<p>Way back in junior high, I took an aptitude test that gave me a single career option: freelance writer</a>. I remember feeling rather panicky at the time, wondering how the hell I&rsquo;d manage to pull it off. But now I do.</p>

<p>My essays have appeared in multiple places, but mostly I write on my blog <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>. I've published four collections of my public talks, <em><a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> (2014), <em><a href="http://monsters2.hackeducation.com">The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> (2015), <em><a href="http://monsters3.hackeducation.com">The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> (2016), and <em><a href="http://monsters4.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology 4</a></em>, as well as a book arguing that students should control their digital identities and digital work, <em><a href="http://reclaim.hackeducation.com">Claim Your Domain</a></em>. I'm in the middle of writing my next book, <em><a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a></em>, which will be published by MIT Press.</p>

<p>I was a recipient of a Spencer Education Journalism Fellowship at Columbia University School of Journalism for the 2017-2018 academic year.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I read, rabble-rouse, and prepare for the zombie apocalypse. Because you never know...</p>

<h3>About Hack Education</h3>
<br />

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018-01-01-pigeon640.jpg"></p>

<p>I created <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a> in June 2010 shortly after I became a technology journalist. I was frustrated by the lack of coverage of education technology -- by both technology and education publications. I did my day job (that is, the freelance writing I got paid for) but devoted as much attention as possible to Hack Education, trying to create the sort of publication that I'd want to read: one that's smart and snarky, one that's free of advertising and investor influence (See:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/disclosures/">Disclosures</a>), one that's tracking new technologies but not just because of some hyperbolic "revolution."</p>

<p>To &ldquo;hack&rdquo; can mean a lot of things: To break in and break down. To cut to the core. &nbsp;To chop roughly. To be playful and clever. To be mediocre. To solve a problem, but to do so rather inelegantly. To pull systems apart. &nbsp;To "MacGyver" things back together. To re-code. To rebuild. To &ldquo;Hack Education,&rdquo; in turn, can have multiple interpretations, I recognize: a technological solution, a technology intrusion, a technological possibility, a technological disaster. Ed-tech is all those things.</p>

<p>To "hack education" isn't something that just technologists should do or care about. Nor is this just a concern for teachers, administrators, parents, or students. We all should consider the implications of technology on how we teach and learn, lest the future of ed-tech be just like the history of ed-tech: learners as <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/12/25/pigeons">pigeons</a>.</p>
