<p>I made a bunch of updates to my various websites and GitHub projects this week, primarily to delete my call to &#8220;support Hack Education.&#8221; I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m doing enough public-facing work right now to warrant soliciting funds from folks. I have also put my Patreon account on &#8220;pause.&#8221;</p>

<p>I submitted a proposal for an <a href="http://objectsobjectsobjects.com/contact/">Object Lessons</a> piece of writing.</p>

<p>I went to the eye doctor. I put this under &#8220;work&#8221; here because I can&#8217;t see without contacts or glasses, and I can&#8217;t work without being able to see. A new city means a new eye doctor, and I hit it off with this one. We had a great talk about how policy shapes technology, among other things, so the visit was quite helpful for my thinking through the upcoming edits to my book (and not just so I will be able to see to do them).</p>
