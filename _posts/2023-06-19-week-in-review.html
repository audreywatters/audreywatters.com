<p>Everything is in shambles, quite literally, as the packers and movers arrive tomorrow, and while they've been hired to deal with everything, I don't believe that &quot;everything&quot; means everything — so I've packed and sorted and disassembled quite a bit. It's a mess.</p>

<p>So yeah, we're moving east. More details forthcoming, once things are a bit more settled and situated and — vague, I realize — resolved.</p>

<p>Kaia came out to visit and to deal with the things she'd left in the spare bedroom closet. While she was here, we ate Ba Mi Banh Li — the best banh mi I've ever had; Dela Curo — Japanese black curry, which I'd never had before and was delicious (pictured above is the very Instagrammable fruit sando); and Tacos Oscar — I had the charred broccoli tacos again, along with a bean and cheese tostada which damn was extraordinary; and Ming's Tasty, for dim sum. Kin ordered so much dim sum that I think all the ladies serving the food were laughing their asses off at it. I'm not sure it'll make for great roadtrip leftovers, but one of the benefits of having the RV is we don't have to eat our way through middle America.</p>

<p>I went on my last donut run with the Lake Merritt donut runners. I saw my PT for the last time too. She thinks I can BQ — folks, get you a PT who believes in you like Dr. Bui believes in me.</p>

<p>Next week, I'll be writing this from somewhere… east.</p>
