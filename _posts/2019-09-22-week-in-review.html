<li>On Saturday night, Kin and I saw Flogging Molly and Social Distortion. It&#8217;s been almost 15 years since I saw the latter &#8211; it was Anthony&#8217;s last concert and friends played &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221; (their version) at his memorial service. So it&#8217;s always special to hear them play. This was their 40th anniversary tour, but Mike Ness still got it.</li>
