<p>While many Americans make big plans for Memorial Day Weekend, our travel plans start this upcoming Friday — we're heading to Oregon to again recreate some of the hikes that Kin and Isaiah did during their &quot;Drone Recovery&quot; summer.</p>

<p>We're in &quot;waiting mode,&quot; I guess, with anticipation for this trek — and what would have been Isaiah's 30th birthday. We're also in &quot;waiting mode&quot; to hear back on some follow-up test results for Poppy and her bladder maybe kidneys maybe nothing maybe tumor sort of horror. </p>

<p>In the meantime, I have the obligatory food updates to share: we had a most delicious coffee at <a href="https://delahcoffee.com">Delah Coffee</a> — I had a baklava and Kin had some cheesecake. If you're in Oakland and looking for a good place to sit and work, well, good luck getting a seat at Delah's as everyone else has the same idea. I had a delicious birria taco from <a href="https://www.la-santa-torta.com">La Santa Torta</a> taco truck with my lifting coach KB. Kin and I ate the omakase at <a href="https://www.delageoakland.com">Delage</a>, and it was expensive and exquisite — the black cod katsu was the best piece of fried fish I've ever had in my life, and I have eaten a lot of fried fish. (The header image is of the <em>amuse bouche</em>, and that little bubble was "crystal bread" (like one little crispy air bubble from <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pan-de-cristal-recipe"><em>pan de cristal</a></em>), topped with smoked salmon, an edible flower, wasabi cream, microgreens, and a tuile made from bamboo charcoal. <em>Amuse bouche</em> > <em>hors d'oeuvres</em> > appetizer every goddamn time.) On the homefront, I made <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012523-coconut-nut-macaroons">macaroons</a> for the first time, and they turned out quite well (perhaps a little sweet for my taste, but Kin, typically not a fan of coconut, likes them so that's a win).</p>

<p>In other things to feed your body: it's on a lot of folks' &quot;recommended summer reading lists&quot; and I heartily agree: Malcolm Harris's <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/93920/9780316592031">Palo Alto</a></em> is the best book we've read so far this year. It's about the history of the town and its university and President Hoover and its tech industry libertarian racist fuckery. If you know Harris then you know it's going to be biting and funny and radical AF. Speaking of revolutions and remaking histories, we finished Season 3 of <em><a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/the-great-238db0d4-c476-47ed-9bee-d326fd302f7d">The Great</a></em> — loved it. </p>

<p>Now, I'm off to make my To Do list for this upcoming road trip. Oh, and I guess I'm going to officially unveil <em><a href="https://2ndbreakfast.substack.com">Second Breakfast</a></em> this week — so I have some planning to do for that too.</p>
