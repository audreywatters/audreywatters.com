<p>The revisions went a little more slowly this week, as I spent a chunk of time down in San Francisco, a city which has become so much like New York &#8211; that is, nowhere to sit in a coffee shop and work. I also set up a Facebook page and an Instagram account for the book. I know it&#8217;s too early to think about book promotion, but there ya go. </p>

<p>This past week: San Francisco. (Kin has <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2019/09/12/i-am-joining-postman-as-their-chief-evangelist/">a new job</a> there.) Upcoming week: Seattle. (No, we&#8217;re not moving back to California. Not now, at least.)</p>
