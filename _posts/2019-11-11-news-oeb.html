<p>I was <a href="https://www.trainingjournal.com/articles/interviews/tj-interviews-oeb-2019-keynote-audrey-watters">recently interviewed</a> by <em>Training Journal</em> about my upcoming keynote at OEB. When asked what I planned to speak about, I said, "The conference is weeks away! I don't know yet exactly what I'm going to talk about. But I have been thinking of the stories we tell about the history and the future of education and education technology."
