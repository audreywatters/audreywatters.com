<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2022/06/15/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish">I posted a &quot;goodbye&quot; over on Hack Education this morning</a>. I won't be updating that site any longer; I won't be working in or (hopefully) even adjacent to ed-tech any more. I want to write about other things, but as long as I cling to the &quot;ed-tech's Cassandra&quot; identity, it's hard to become someone else.</p>

<p>I probably do have a wee bit more to say about ed-tech — the &quot;good riddance&quot; part — but I don't feel like posting it on Hack Education. I'll write about it here — therapeutically, I reckon. But I don't really want to continue to churn out criticism of the field/industry/discipline. Sufficed to say: folks will bend over backwards to justify the most fucked-up tools and the most oppressive educational practices and technologies. Some folks will say yes, the technology is bad — if we just had better technology then everything'd be okay. Others will say that it's our educational practices that suck — if we just had better pedagogies, then everything technological would fall into place. Both camps still insist that the future is &quot;digital,&quot; and as such, are trapped in a story that will never get them to &quot;better&quot; because the foundations will always be rotten. And so few people in ed-tech, so fixated on their fantasies about the future, want to talk about that.</p>
