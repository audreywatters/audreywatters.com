<br />
<p>I got some feedback on the book this week that was&#8230; how should I say&#8230; &#8220;harsh but fair.&#8221; It&#8217;s got me rethinking a lot of things &#8211; content, style, organization. I think there&#8217;s a gulf between the book that some people expect me to write and the one that I&#8217;ve written. Not sure how I&#8217;m going to address that (or if I have to).</p>

<br />
<p>I&#8217;m still listening to <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> on audiobook. I have Astra Taylor&#8217;s new one, <em>Democracy May Not Exist, But We&#8217;ll Miss It When It&#8217;s Gone</em>, sitting on my desk, but I&#8217;ve only read the first few sentences. I struggle to process more than one non-fiction book at a time. I went to the bookstore yesterday to buy some new fiction, but came out empty-handed.</p>
