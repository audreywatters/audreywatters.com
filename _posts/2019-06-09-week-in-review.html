<p>Hack Education turned 9 this week, and I did not write a post to commemorate the event (yet). I still have a lot to think about with regards to how I&#8217;m going to move the publication forward.</p>

<p>This past week: Kin and I traveled to Eugene for a few days, for his daughter&#8217;s high school graduation. Then, we spent the night in Dufur, Oregon at the historic Balch Hotel. Upcoming week: home.</p>

<p>I read <em>Dreyer&#8217;s English</em>, and I started reading <em>Circe</em>. We also watched the first episode of <em>When They See Us</em>.</p>
