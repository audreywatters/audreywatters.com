<p>I always think of my friend Tim when I cite the line from <em>Deadwood</em>: &quot;Everything changes; don't be afraid.&quot; And here I am again, looking ahead to what is, quite likely, a new start. Again. I won't go into much detail now; it's too soon to say what's going to happen. Or rather, I can say that, whether or not this one particular thing that I can't yet write about happens, things are indeed changing here. I'm starting a big new writing project in 6 weeks. </p>

<p>And this weekend, I'm running another half marathon. </p>

<p>That's not really new. That's actually the culmination of a plan I put in motion last year. Although this will be HM #2, it's actually the one I'd planned on doing first, the one I signed up for on the heels of running my very first 5K in March of last year. It's across the Bay Bridge, which feels Quite Symbolic. </p>

<p>So that means this week is a taper week, where I sit on the couch a lot and reckon with how very much my mental health is tied up in maintaining a frenetic pace of activity, of training. Although my brain says &quot;stay busy,&quot; my body is definitely ready for the break. On Tuesday's final speed workout, I really pushed myself, and then when I went into the gym a few hours later, I had the worst workout of my life. Every lift was terrible. I failed a bench press for the first time. (It wasn't a big deal; I had the safeties set and wasn't crushed by the barbell or anything. I could wriggle my way out from under it.)</p>

<p>On Saturday, Kin and I ate out at Yonsei Handrolls again. The first time we were there, we were really blown away, but this time around, I was a little disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were just too high; rather, I think, the quality had dipped rather dramatically. The wagyu beef was chewy; it's not supposed to be chewy. I cannot handle chewy meat <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>(Saturday was "Bagel Day," and I will say that Boichik Bagels continue to be chewy. And that's perfect —4 exactly how a bagel is supposed to be.)

<p>I read Virginia Sole-Smith's book <em>The Eating Instinct</em> last year, and it made me think about all sorts of issues surrounding our cultural and personal expectations of eating (and, particularly as a mom, of feeding others). I finished her latest book <em>Fat Talk</em> last night; I'll post a book review over on Substack today or tomorrow — that's where you'll find me writing more <a href="https://substack.com/profile/534530-audrey-watters/note/c-15165249">etc etc etc</a>. I'll just say here that it's probably The Must Read book for parents and grandparents in helping them not be utterly toxic to their kids vis-a-vis bodies and diet culture.</p>
