<p>As of December 1, I will (mostly) turn off social media until the draft of my book is done. </p>

<p>I won&#8217;t be on Facebook &#8211; that dumpster fire is pretty easy to walk away from. I won&#8217;t check Twitter regularly &#8211; a bit harder to do, I confess (even though it is still such a toxic site). I won&#8217;t be on Instagram &#8211; unless something really photogenic happens, I suppose. </p>

<p>Of course, if I publish an article, I will probably log in to Facebook and Twitter share it &#8211; I still have to maintain the self-employment hustle. But I&#8217;m deleting the apps from my phone (I never check the sites via my laptop). I&#8217;m not deleting or deactivating accounts &#8211; unless I just can&#8217;t keep away as the deadline looms.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be writing on my websites regularly or not. We&#8217;ll see. (You can subscribe to their RSS feeds if you so choose &#8211; just add &#8220;feed.xml&#8221; to the end of any of my sites&#8217; URLs.) As it stands, I do plan to continue to send out the <a href="http://hewn.substack.com">HEWN</a> newsletter, although it might not go out every Saturday. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll still be reachable <a href="mailto:mail@audreywatters.com">via email &#8211; mail@audreywatters.com</a>. You can also send me postcards. I&#8217;ll write back. (You might even have better luck getting me to respond to the latter than the former.)</p>
