<p>Nothing to report this week, really. I'm working on a talk I'll deliver at the end of the month. I don't know where the time goes each week, quite honestly. Errands, I guess? Because if I do one outing, I'm sort of spent for the day.</p>

<p>I read Joseph Weizenbaum's <em>Computer Power and Human Reason</em>. I'm finding reading to be incredibly difficult. We also started listening to the new podcast on the Scorpions' song &quot;Winds of Change.&quot; Was it a CIA plant?</p>
