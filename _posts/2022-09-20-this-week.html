<p>I'm a day late posting my weekly reflection because you know what's good? Convincing Kin to take a four-day weekend.</p>

<p>We went on RV trip number 2 this past weekend, driving up to Humboldt County for three nights. It was a wonderful getaway. There are so many hikes to do in the area, so we'll definitely be back. (Indeed, after I finish writing this, I'm going to make reservations for our next three road trips, including a return trip north.)</p>

<p>My mom bought me a portable gas grill for my birthday — it hooks right up to the RV's propane tanks, and I made burgers one night and pizza the next. The burgers were delicious — there's nothing quite like burgers while camping. And the pizza turned out surprisingly well too, with a nice char on the crust. These'll likely be meals I put on repeat as they're easy. That along with pancakes on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>My lifting coach's parents live in Arcata, and she recommended we try <a href="https://www.losbagels.com">Los Bagels</a> while up there. I didn't really love the bagels — I'm sort of ride or die for <a href="https://boichikbagels.com">Boichik Bagels</a> in Berkeley, I won't lie. But I did try the Casey's Thai Bagel, which had peanut butter, jalapeño jam, grated carrot, cucumbers, and green onion. And it was really quite a good flavor combination. It's not a flavor combo I'd dare put on a New York bagel, mind you. But when in Rome, as they say…</p>

<p>The other &quot;good food&quot; update from the road: I bought an <a href="https://amzn.to/3Lwap31">AeroPress coffee maker</a>. I was looking for something that was easier to clean up than the ol' French Press. And I was really impressed with how good the coffee was with such a quick brew.</p>

<p>Well, one more food update, I suppose. After a weekend getaway where I cooked everything — and that's fine, as I love to cook — we did get take-out last night. <a href="https://www.theshawarmaji.com">Shawarmaji</a> is just around the corner from us, and while we'd eaten there when Fred and the kids visited, I'd forgotten how delicious it was. Shawarma reminds me of Isaiah — it was probably one of his favorite foods. He'd always complain when meals weren't spicy enough, and I remember when I took him to Halal Guys in New York, and he doused his food with their infamous red sauce. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he winced, &quot;that is the hottest sauce I've ever had.&quot; Shawarmaji's hot sauce isn't as hot as Halal Guys; but it's more flavorful. (Everything about Shawarmaji is better than Halal Guys, bless.) The chicken saroukh is well over a foot long, but I devoured it quickly, before the spicy red sauce soaked through the wrapper and stained my fingers.</p>

<p>Other good things:</p>

<ul>
<li>We finished listening to Bruce Springsteen's memoir <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3qUYRg8">Born to Run</a></em>. I'm not sure I like Bruce Springsteen any more or less after listening to it; but I definitely appreciate his writing much more. And I admire him for how honest he was about his struggles with mental illness.</li>
<li>I got my third booster shot on Wednesday, with no side effects. The pharmacist upsold me on a flu shot too. I have a feeling it's going to be a rough flu season with everyone back out and breathing on one another after a couple of years wintering indoors.</li>
<li>&quot;A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction,&quot; Virginia Woolf famously wrote. I have the second part of that now — with some uncertainty about what the hell I'm going to do to earn the first part and no real commitment to write fiction, but anyway. Kaia left for college, and I have the spare bedroom back as my space, which since we moved to Oakland, has never really had a chance to become my <em>writing</em> space. I'm hoping to find some time to plan out exactly how I want to arrange it, all the while making sure it's still a place that Kaia can return to for holidays and so on.</li>
