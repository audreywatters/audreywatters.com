<p>I&#8217;ve been working this week on the &#8220;Afterword,&#8221; which is perhaps an indulgent sort of chapter to have, but whatever.</p>

<p>I chatted with Amy Chapman about a project she&#8217;s working on regarding women and ed-tech.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not &#8220;work&#8221;; it&#8217;s democracy. But I voted. I also made a few end-of-the-month changes to my websites. And I signed a bunch of paperwork for the sale of land in Texas that apparently my brother and I inherited.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in currently New Orleans, and I&#8217;m writing this on a very full stomach of oysters and po&#8217;boy. Upcoming week: Here, then home.</p>

<br />
<p>I read Joanne McNeil&#8217;s <em>Lurking: How a Person Became a User</em> on the flight to NOLA.</p>
