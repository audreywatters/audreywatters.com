<p>Another action-packed week:</p>

<p>Due to Rosh Hashanah, Ess-a-Bagel was closed over the weekend, so we had bagels delivered on Monday. I met up with Coach KB at S&amp;P on Monday — it was so good to see her. I miss Bay Strength so much. I chose S&amp;P because it is A Classic Diner — best known for its tuna melt, with Katherine ordered. I had the burger, which was great. The service was the perfect combination of brisk and frenetic. We shared a &quot;dusty miller&quot; for dessert — a sundae with fluff and malt powder. Pretty amazing.</p>

<p>In other food news, Kin and I got tacos at Los Tacos No. 1 Tuesday evening, and my god, these were just stellar. (We were supposed to go to a book reading at the NYPL, but didn't make it, opting for dessert at Oasis instead.) We ate out again on Saturday at one of several neighborhood ramen joints — Totto's Ramen, this time, which was sadly disappointing. Kin also went up to the UWS on Saturday to get Absolute Bagels. I cooked sweet and spicy tofu with soba noodles, beef pie with a cheddar cheese crust, bean and sweet potato enchiladas, artichoke and goat cheese pasta bake, and an amazing applesauce pecan layer cake.</p>

<p>On Second Breakfast, I wrote about protein tiramisu pancakes, coffee technology, and the week's food/fitness tech news.</p>

<p>I saw the eye doctor.</p>

<p>Neil Selwyn published <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1301377/13600981-audrey-watters-second-breakfast">the podcast episode</a> I did with him. </p>

<p>My runs all went pretty well, despite Tropical Storm Ophelia. On Tuesday, I did a 25 minute tempo run (while listening to the <em>Maintenance Phase</em> podcast); on Thursday, I ran for an hour and listened to the Nike Run Club guided run with Eliud Kipchoge — the GOAT, who won his fifth Berlin Marathon this weekend; on Saturday I ran 13.5 miles — the longest long run of this training block (while listening to the latest <em>Barbell Medicine</em> podcast on anemia); on Sunday, I looked at the weather and copped out, running my 45 minute recovery run on the treadmill while watching a couple episodes of <em>Physical</em>.</p>

<p>In other media, we finished Naomi Klein's Doppelgänger, which I cannot recommend highly enough. I finished Momfluenced, which was pretty awful, tbh. We watched <em>Jules</em>, as well as the latest episodes of <em>Only Murders in the Building</em> and <em>Reservation Dogs</em> — I am going to be so sad when this show ends; it is just so perfect.</p>

<p>I also biked to and from the gym. At the gym, I did squats, bench presses, bulgarian split squats, single leg RDLs, reverse lunges, deadlifts, and overhead presses — I only went up in weight on the squats and RDLs. That said, I'm pretty happy about how things are progressing, particularly with as hard as I am training for this half marathon. And I am trying to teach myself how to do flip turns in the pool — easier said than done. (And I don't really find watching YouTube videos as good as having a coach or instructor — that's the subject, sort of, of an essay I'm working on today for Second Breakfast.)</p>
