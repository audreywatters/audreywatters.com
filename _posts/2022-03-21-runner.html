<p>Yesterday morning, I ran my first 5K race. It was my first race ever. It was, as a matter of fact, the first time in my life I've participated in any sort of athletic competition. I never played competitive sports as a kid — neither on a team nor as an individual. And I certainly haven't done so as an adult.</p>

<p>Growing up, I generally eschewed all manner of physical activity. I told myself I wasn't good at any of it. I wasn't strong; I wasn't fast; I couldn't catch or throw or dribble or hit. </p>

<p>I knew that, with practice, you can get better at just about anything you set your mind to. I knew that about playing the piano, learning my 7-times tables, speaking French, and so on — but I never ever thought that way about sports. I was destined, I figured, to suck.</p>

<p>Over the course of the past year, I've developed a new level of fitness, a new sense of self: now, I am an athlete. Now, I am a runner.</p>

<p>Late last year, I set my mind to running a 5K. I can't tell you the last time I'd run anywhere for any reason. I mean, I wouldn't even run to catch a train; I'd say &quot;fuck it, I'll get the next one&quot; rather than pick up the pace. The last time I ran must've been junior high PE and as such, I certainly wasn't running by choice. (Funny story: I actually didn't graduate from high school as I was missing one credit in PE. I did the IB in the UK, so the lack of a high school diploma wasn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things.)</p>

<p>What a miserable experience PE always was. I dreaded it. I hated playing basketball, volleyball, baseball, kickball, field hockey, or whatever sport the class cycled through. Being picked last for teams was, of course, mortifying. But it was <em>all</em> mortifying, frankly, whether or not others were relying on me as a teammate: I couldn't do a cartwheel, I couldn't climb the rope. (The two weeks we'd spend on square dancing were a nice respite, I suppose, but as I now know <a href="https://qz.com/1153516/americas-wholesome-square-dancing-tradition-is-a-tool-of-white-supremacy/">the white supremacist origins of that activity</a>, I can't look back too fondly. The only good thing ever to happen in PE was when the teacher brought out the parachute. I would love to learn the origins of that activity, which much like the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintenance-phase/id1535408667?i=1000495386842">President's Physical Fitness Test</a>, exemplifies how strange and arbitrary much of what happens in PE can be.) PE went from bad to worse in junior high, when we had to change into &quot;gym clothes&quot; — short shorts and a tee-shirt with knee-high socks, if I recall correctly — adding to the general humiliation of PE by simply having a pubescent body. I distinctly remember, for example, in seventh grade when a classmate informed me it was gross that I didn't shave my legs. </p>

<p>I often told myself that it didn't matter that I wasn't any good at PE; I was good at the rest of school — the part that mattered, I thought (not ever realizing that there were plenty of kids who were made to feel in the classroom like I was made to feel in the gym: awkward, incapable, weak, a failure; and not really thinking that physical activity was, in fact, pretty damn important).</p>

<p>There was never any pressure on me to play sports. Neither of my parents were particularly athletic. Indeed, my dad had sustained a serious injury in PE class at community college, severely fracturing his femur (and rendering him ineligible for the Vietnam War draft) — a major source of mental and physical anguish. So there were no family outings to ski or skate. There were the obligatory swimming lessons every summer, I guess. This was the one activity I truly enjoyed, and I do vaguely remember swimming in an ad hoc relay race one Fourth of July when I was eight or nine. I seem to recall our next door neighbor drunkenly cheering me on, but I couldn't see and I swam diagonally rather than straight across the pool. Our team lost.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't see.&quot; That's been such a major part of how I experience the world around me. I found out I needed glasses when I registered for kindergarten. My eyesight was terrible — so terrible I marveled, my mom says, when heading home from the eye doctor's office wearing my first pair of glasses, that the trees had leaves. My eyesight <em>is</em> terrible. Without my contacts, I can barely see beyond my nose. It isn't simply that I'm incredibly nearsighted. I'm also left-eye dominant and right-handed, which helps explain my utter inability to catch a ball, even when wearing corrective lenses. And even when wearing those lenses, my eyesight still is far from 20-20. </p>

<p>No surprise, I've always been fond of the comic book character Daredevil, as he personifies the idea that the loss of one sense — in his case, sight — heightens the others. I'm no superhero, however, and my bad eyesight hasn't translate into better perception in any way. Indeed, my proprioception has been abysmal: I've always been awkward, off-balance, tripping and falling over my own two feet (or moving slowly and cautiously, afraid of tripping and falling). </p>

<p>I've never had high expectations for what my body could do. Even so, when my health really unraveled in 2020 (my heart was broken — literally, metaphorically), I was sort of shocked that my body would betray me. For the first time since PE class, I felt as though my body let me down. But this time, I decided to tell a different story about how I wanted it to feel, what I wanted it to do.</p>

<p>Running was not on the To Do list — not initially. I've spent enough time being miserable in gym class, and as a grown-ass woman — even one committed to &quot;physical fitness&quot; — I swore I'd never do any activities that I didn't love. I love yoga. I love weight-lifting. I love walking. I love swimming. But running? Good grief. All I could think about was PE: how track season would come each spring and after a long, cold winter in Wyoming, it would be glorious to have class outside — right up until the point we were made to run sprints and — even worse — jump hurdles. </p>

<p>I'm not sure what made me decide to sign up for a 5K. Perhaps it was seeing my brother-in-law run in the Portland Marathon and then, only a few weeks later, the Chicago Marathon. Perhaps it was seeing all the runners scoot around Lake Merritt each morning as Kin and I walk the three-and-a-bit miles around it. Three-and-a-bit miles is, of course, 5K — so I must have figured &quot;what the hell.&quot; I downloaded an obligatory Couch-to-5K app, and proceeded to run just a little bit, then a little bit longer, then a little bit longer.</p>

<p>And then yesterday morning, I ran my first 5K race. </p>

<p>I did better than I could have ever imagined, coming in seventh in my age bracket and finishing the course in under 10 minutes/mile. More importantly, I felt great, almost bursting into tears as I approached the final stretch as I was so overwhelmed with emotion at having accomplished this. And as I gave the final push and picked up my pace to cross the finish line, I had another recollection about my childhood: I remembered the joy of running with my neighborhood friends, Eric and Rebecca. They were both faster than me — Eric was a fast little fucker, I seem to recall my dad saying although I really doubt he'd have used the expletive. But there was so much joy in that unbridled play. We didn't need headphones or a running playlist or technology to set the pace or a coach keep our form in line and our spirits up. We were eight or nine years old, pretending we were horses, galloping up and down the street — wild and free.</p>

<p>Maybe that's why, when I saw the footage that Kin took of me crossing the finish line, I had to laugh: I run like a horse. I say that fondly, not critically. I run like I did when I was a kid — a nice trot. </p>

<p>But now my legs are strong. My heart is strong. My lungs are strong. I still can't see where I'm going, true, but I'm starting to have better proprioception now — a better sense of where and how my body is moving through the world.</p>
