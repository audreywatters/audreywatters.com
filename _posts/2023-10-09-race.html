<p>Yesterday could not have been a more perfect day.</p>

<p>We got up early and drove to Staten Island. I know, I know. Part of the NYC running ritual is to navigate the subway and the ferry over there. But as I wanted to have my cheer squad in tow, we took the car. Security was pretty tight at this race; it's so different to run the NYC races than the Oakland ones - the cops, the crowds.</p>

<p>I didn't really know what to expect of myself or of the course. The weather, I will say, was ideal: about 50 degrees and although there were some headwinds in places, it was sunny, but cool. I wanted to beat the time I ran at my last half - the Bay Bridge Half in May - but as 1) that course was a little short and 2) this training block, what with the moving and the weather, was so challenging. I really wasn't sure how fast I could go.</p>

<p>I could go fast. I ran at 8:26/mi according to my watch and 8:30 according to the official time. It was, indeed, a PR. I think I could have done even better if that massive hill at mile 8 hadn't drastically slowed me down. Even so, I was elated.</p>

<p>And my god, it makes all the difference in the world, when running distance races, to have people cheer you on. Kin and Poppy were waiting for me at Mile 6 and I saw them again at Mile 13. It's such a boost - the very Bette Midler cliche of "wind beneath my wings."</p>

<p>After the race, we drove home, ate a bagel, showered, drank some coffee, and then Kin and I headed to Greenwich Village for pizza at one of the classic coal-burning pizza oven joints, John's of Bleecker Street. Afterwards, he popped into a record store and bought some jazz albums. Then we got ice creams at Van Leeuwen.</p>

<p>To top it all off, we watched the <em>Barbie</em> movie before falling asleep by 9pm.</p>

<p>Like I said: pretty much a perfect day.</p>

<p>Indeed, the whole weekend was stellar. On Saturday, we went to Central Park early to take advantage of the off-leash hours with Poppy. Then Kin headed up to Absolute Bagels while I waited for the Doughnut Project delivery at home. So many carbohydrates. I am definitely in recovery mode today and I don't want to run, don't miss running at all. But I know in a few days time, I'll want to get back out there again. And I'll be sad too that I'm not training at a high enough intensity to warrant three doughnuts and a bagel in one morning. (I signed up for the first few 2024 NYRR races this past week, all in preparation to be eligible to run the 2025 NYC Marathon. I was just 2 minutes off from time-qualifying, so perhaps I can get faster for my April half marathon and run it in 2024. But that's a long ways off.)</p>

<p>I bought doughnuts on Friday too - my first ever trip to Kripy Kreme. (Overrated.) I had a pastry on Wednesday when I had coffee with my friend Alicia at Bibble & Sip. (Also overrated.)</p>

<p>Reading / Watching / Listening / Writing / Cooking: I finished <em>Running Grave</em>. We're still listening to the audiobook of <em>Blood in the Machine</em>. I started <em>Your Body is Not an Apology</em>. We watched the season finale of <em>Only Murders in the Building.</em> I listened to parts of Coach Bennett's podcast, and parts of the latest Barbell Medicine podcast. (I'm working on a <em>Second Breakfast</em> show which should be released this week.) I published the usual Second Breakfast newsletters. I can't think of anything particularly exciting that I cooked, other than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/air-fryer-orange-tofu/">this orange tofu in the air fryer</a>.</p>

<p>For the past couple of months, I've told myself that I'd get to things after my half marathon. Well shit. That's today. So I have a massive To Do list today. No more looking back now; moving forward.</p>
