<p>Even though I'm still in training for a(nother!) half marathon, I'm going to re-title this series, back to the ol' &quot;week in review.&quot; And despite last week being a recovery week from that first attempt at 13.1, it was a really busy one: </p>

<p>I finished my Precision Nutrition certification, so I'm now nutrition coach, as well as a personal trainer. (Next certification will be my running coach, but I'm going to do that in person; I'd also like to do some of the coaching-training sessions that Barbell Medicine offers, but that'd require travel, I reckon, and I'm not in a position to do that right now.)</p>

<p>All of these certifications dovetail with my new writing project, which still isn't ready for its big reveal yet, but I reckon I can probably <a href="https://2ndbreakfast.substack.com">link to here</a> as no one reads blogs anymore.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what idiot scheduled a dentist appointment for three days after her half marathon — spoiler alert: it was me. I almost canceled it, but thankfully I was in and out of there in less than 20 minutes, with polished teeth and no cavities to boot. I both love and hate how the dentist (and doctor) have you schedule your next exam six to twelve months in advance. You look at your calendar and chuckle, &quot;Sure, I'm free anytime that day,&quot; and then when that day rolls around, you find the timing is, actually, terrible. So let's see what I'm up to in late September, eh?</p>

<p>Speaking of planning things well in advance, at the beginning of the year, I scheduled weekend getaways for Kin and I for the calendar year — or at least, I snagged one long weekend a month on his calendar so that he'd be forced to take some vacation time. This past weekend was one such getaway — back to Sonoma County to an RV spot we'd been at in November. I was a little worried that, with all the rain we've been having, that it'd be muddy and the Russian River flooded. But it was lovely. I did my first run, post-half marathon, on Friday and even managed an 8-mile long run on Saturday.</p>

<p>It was &quot;pivot week&quot; at the gym — my coach programs me in 12-week blocks, and a new one starts this week. During the &quot;pivot week,&quot; she gives me a bunch of different exercises to do — variations on the squats and deadlifts and so on. It's nice to have a little change to the routine. But this week, it's back to it — back to increasing my running miles to prepare for the Bay Bridge Half in May and back to lifting heavy to make sure I can age injury-free.</p>

<p>The weather, disappointingly, seems to want to continue its programming from the first few months of the year. I should do a speed run tomorrow, but it's supposed to be ghastly, with pouring rain and high winds. I will still run in it — just not at my &quot;threshold&quot; pace — as who knows what the weather will be like when I do my next race. And as it's across the Bay Bridge, already a pretty windy route, I think it's best to prepare for it to be challenging. Also: I'll do anything to avoid running on the &quot;dreadmill&quot; — which if you clicked on that link to my new writing project, you won't be surprised to learn will be a topic of a forthcoming essay.</p>
