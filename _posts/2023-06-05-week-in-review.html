<p>It's almost the end of Monday, and typically I try to get all my writing done in the mornings. Once it gets to be afternoon, I find it hard to write. (The challenge here is that I find the same to be true for running: so I try to front-load my days as much as possible so I can just collapse after midday.)</p>

<p>We hiked up Kerby Peak today — almost 8 miles, with some 2700 feet of elevation gain. I'm not hurting too badly — a double cheeseburger and an hour-and-a-half long nap helped — but Kin and Poppy are a little beat-up.</p>

<p>So it's just a quick week-in-review — a bulleted list of things. I can't even upload photos as there's no WiFi in this campground.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm saving the photos for my &quot;What's Good&quot; newsletter on Friday. Second Breakfast officially launches on Sunday, and as I haven't looked at the news at all this week, what with being on the road, subscribers'll have to make due with photos of the flowers I saw today and reviews of the breakfast items I've eaten on the road. Today was a breakfast burrito — a bit heavy in the belly for the climb in the heat.</p>

<p>I announced <a href="http://2ndbreakfast.substack.com">Second Breakfast</a> to HEWN this week, and I've been overwhelmed with the response. That's nice. I feel like maybe I am a writer again.</p>

<p>On our way out of town, we ate at Bud's Giant Burgers in Vallejo — perhaps the best burger I've ever had in my life. (Also ate a double cheeseburger. Truly the best option.)</p>

<p>We're headed to Bolan Lake tomorrow — a hike we weren't able to do last summer because of forest fire. Not sure what our legs will be able to handle; not sure what state the area will be in.</p>
