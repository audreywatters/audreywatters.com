<p>When I first started contemplating what I'd write about this past week, I wasn't sure I could find much &quot;good.&quot; It wasn't a bad week, necessarily. I mean, Kin was out of town for half of it, so that sucked. Kaia left too; she's up in Oregon visiting her mom and her friends. I can't help but worry about how travel introduces the possibility of COVID into our household — worries that are exacerbated since COVID arrived in my immediate family this week, with Amelia, Emmett, and Emily (my brother's partner) all testing positive. </p>

<p>[Deleted a paragraph here because ugh, I do not want to write about or think about ed-tech.]</p>

<p>ANYWAY.</p>

<p>What's good?</p>

<p>Well, dammit, my dal is not. Dal is one of my favorite foods, and I just haven't been able to make a version of it that I love. I always experiment with a different recipe when Kin's on the road. It's sort of silly, because as a recipe usually serves, like, eight, I'm stuck eating a very mediocre pot of beans for the entire time he's gone. I need to get a good vegetarian Indian cookbook. (I have the Dishoom restaurant's, but its dal recipe takes about 8 hours — which is perhaps part of my problem: I'm not letting the spices really develop long enough.)</p>

<p>So, what's good?</p>

<p>Our Saturday ritual of hiking the Berkeley hills before picking up a dozen bagels at Boichik. The frangipane tart I made with the delicious King Pluots from Frog Hollow Farm. Alexandra Stafford's <a href="https://farmsharenewsletter.substack.com/">Farm Share newsletter</a> that, as the name suggests, helps me come up with ideas on how to use the stuff in our CSA. The <a href="https://oaktownspiceshop.com/products/golden-milk">Golden Milk</a> powder from Oaktown Spice Shop, which I restocked this week. (Love the taste; love the anti-inflammatory health benefits of turmeric, particularly as I ramp up my running; and love Oaktown Spice Shop.) I made a gochuchang sourdough bread, and it was phenomenal. The first few chapters of David Graeber's <em>The Dawn of Everything</em> (not to imply that only the first few chapters are good; rather, I just cracked it open this week).</p>

<p>And then yesterday, Kin and I bought an RV trailer, which is very exciting. We really enjoy road trips and hiking, and it's been sort of a pain to find places that will accommodate Poppy. It's going to be a challenge — a good challenge — learning to live (and cook and shit and shower) in one. But I think it'll open up a lot more places and a lot more hikes for us. California is such an amazing state, and we have a lot to see here. I'm hoping too to start trail running, and perhaps having the door open up into the woods will help me start that.</p>

<p>And <em>that's</em> good. </p>
