<p>The manuscript is back in the hands of MIT Press. I am really pleased with how it finally came together, after much thinking and rethinking of what I wanted the book to do. Now, I'm in the process of securing permissions. Wheee.</p>

<p>I'm starting to get a bit worried about what my spring is going to look like. I have a lot of speaking gigs lined up, but they're starting to be canceled. And don't get me wrong. I totally understand the necessity of canceling events under these circumstances. It's still going to suck financially. </p>

<h3>Traveling <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_travel.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>This past week: the Bay Area. Upcoming week: Travel has been canceled or postponed. We are now, for the next few weeks at least, at home in Seattle.</p>

<h3>Reading and Viewing and Listening <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_bookmark.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>

<p>I haven't done a good job keeping up with what I've read or watched lately. Nor have I been keeping up with this weekly update either. Things are tough all over. I'll try to do better.</p>
