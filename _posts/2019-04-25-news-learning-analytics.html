	<p>For many years now, Audrey Watters, an education writer and independent scholar based in the U.S., has been a vocal critic of education technology on her site Hack Education. Calling herself "ed-tech's Cassandra," she remains deeply skeptical of learning analytics, not just because of questions of privacy but because of what it signifies more widely about trends in education.</p>
