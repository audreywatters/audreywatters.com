<p>We're back in Oakland — for a week or so. Then — oh hey, big news — we're packing up and moving. But that's <em>next</em> week. Here are some of the highlights of this past week (written quickly because holy shit we are moving and I have so much to do):</p>

<ul>
<li>I launched <em><a href="http://2ndbreakfast.substack.com">Second Breakfast</a></em>, and I'm pretty thrilled with the response</li>
<li>We hiked a bit in Southern Oregon and Northern California — Rogue River, Crescent City, Trinidad. Or at least, I ran a lot in those places — lots of hills; half marathon training starts again next week, and I'm wishing I felt more rested</li>
<li>We ate a double cheeseburger (again) at Bud's Giant Burgers in Vallejo</li>
<li>We ate some delicious donuts and breakfast burritos — Kin's had sausage gravy in it?! Genius! — at McIntosh Country Store in Arcata</li>
<li>We went to McDonalds and Taco Bell in Grants Pass to compare their breakfast offerings — let's call it &quot;research&quot; for <em>Second Breakfast</em></li>
<li>I was mentioned in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/business/khan-ai-gpt-tutoring-bot.html">NYTimes article</a> on Khan Academy's ongoing attempts to automate education</li>
<li>We were mostly without WiFi during our trip. And as such, I read four books (and started two more) — the best kind of vacation, in my opinion, is one where you read a bunch. Recommended: <em>Ancestor Troubles</em> — the book is memoir and an exploration of white supremacy and genealogy and DNA analysis. As we were back in Oregon to do our annual memorial hike for Isaiah, there was so much to think about how we have invented claims to a place when our ancestors' claim to this land — all of this country — was a seizure of <em>someone else</em>'s home. For me, this is liberating: I don't want to be or need to be tied to any place here in the US, particularly in the Pacific NW (or even the west coast) where I have experienced so much loss and trauma. I love some of the places here, don't get me wrong. It's beautiful. But I am not bound to it spiritually or genealogically. I can let go; I can move on</li>
