<p>Well, it&#8217;s 31 March, and the draft of <em>Teaching Machines</em> isn&#8217;t complete. I&#8217;m trying not to freak out &#8211; I mean, we&#8217;re finally settled here in Seattle, and there&#8217;s no excuse to not focus on the writing. So hopefully I can finish it up quickly.</p>

<br />
<p>I didn&#8217;t send out a HEWN this week, and I won&#8217;t until the draft of the book is done. Gotta prioritize. But I also gotta earn some money, so I did work this week on a short article to preview the book &#8211; a promotional piece for a talk that I&#8217;ll give this fall in Berlin.</p>

<br />
<p>Kin and I watched <em>The Inventor</em>, the HBO documentary about Elizabeth Holmes. I didn&#8217;t think it was nearly as good as John Carreyou&#8217;s book on Theranos, but it was interesting to see and hear some of the main characters, as well as to watch the journalists who&#8217;d hyped the startup come to terms with how they were taken for a ride.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had Kin&#8217;s daughter visiting us this week. Spring Break and whatnot.</p>
