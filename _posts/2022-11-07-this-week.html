<p>I ran my first trail race on Saturday — an 8K at Lake Chabot — alongside the students with RBO. I've been fairly nervous about this one: it's the longest distance I've raced, and the weather forecast was sketchy. Rain is so needed here in California, but not really what I wanted for trekking up and down hills. But it went really well, and I did even better than I anticipated. I ran the course in under 45 minutes, coming first in my age/gender bracket. I was, in fact, the sixth woman and 25th runner overall. Not too shabby. I got a medal, impressing the students I run with (or so I'd like to think).</p>

<p>On one hand, it's easy to say that once you hit 50 as a woman, no one really expects much of you — athletically or otherwise. You show up; you're a winner. There isn't a lot of competition — there were only 9 women in my bracket, and only 150 or so runners overall.</p>

<p>That said, I think it's really important to celebrate what older women can do. I mean, I ran faster than most of the kids. </p>

<p>We don't celebrate menopause — hell, we don't even <em>talk</em> about menopause — and as of November 1 (or so), I am officially post-menopausal. (I guess it's official, right? Do I need a doctors note?) </p>

<p>How did I celebrate? I ran. And then I rested. </p>

<p>Recovery is key, I'm finding, to my running. Recovery — big big picture recovery — is key to everything. I like to remind myself that, physically at least, I am the strongest I've ever been, the fastest I've ever been. And I am getting stronger and faster.</p>

<p><em>Physically, at least</em>. Mentally, I don't know. I mean, the recovery process there isn't quite so simple as a big meal and a good nap. </p>

<p>The stories we tell about aging are very rapped up in a belief that post-menopausal women are past their reproductive utility, past their prime — their bodies, already weak, can only diminish from here on out. &quot;Science&quot; says otherwise, but even &quot;science&quot; remains wrapped up in that patriarchal thinking (and a lack of much research), and while it might give me another decade or so to be physically strong, it still tends to describe post-menopausal aging as an inevitable decline and decay rather than growth, adaptation, resilience. Our culture never trusts women's bodies (women rarely trust their own); but as women age that mistrust often turns to outright disgust.</p>

<p>I'm very new in any &quot;athlete&quot; circles, and as an ethnographer, that's always a fascinating and eye-opening process. (I'm very excited, incidentally to go hear Alison Mariella Désir speak next week about her book <em>Running While Black</em>. Runners like to think of their community as very open. But it's one thing to say &quot;everyone is welcome,&quot; and it's another thing entirely to build community with all bodies in mind.) I hear so many people younger than me speak with nostalgia about the athlete they once were. Me, I'm not trying to retain or regain my youth — some previous version of Audrey; I'm working on becoming the next me — and that next me is measurably (if incrementally) faster for now, but forever and ever also immeasurably stronger.</p>
