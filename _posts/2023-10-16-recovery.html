<p>I need to write about the hype around &quot;recovery&quot; for <em>Second Breakfast</em>. To be clear, that's recovery as it relates to fitness, not drug/alcohol addiction. Although I should write about the latter too. And I now that I'm making that note, I should perhaps think about how the two may or may not be connected.</p>

<p>Anyway, this past week was about &quot;recovery&quot; ostensibly — giving my body a chance to recuperate from the half marathon. I didn't run — until Saturday and Sunday, that is, which made this the lowest mileage week of 2023. I did, on the other hand, ride my bike more than usual, taking four (as opposed to the usual two) trips down to Chelsea Piers Fitness. I swam twice and weightlifted twice, thanking the stars that I've been trained to utilized &quot;RPE&quot; — rate of perceived exertion — for modulating the latter. Although I did more reps, I only lifted to @7, which meant the weights were much lighter than usual. Even so, I had some DOMs after Wednesday's squat session, more discomfort than I had from the half-marathon.</p>

<p>Kin was sick again last week. Being back in the office and exposed to germs is wrecking havoc on his immune system, clearly. So without the normal walk-to-work, Poppy and I had multiple morning walks in Central Park. It's fun as, up until 9am, you can have your dog off-leash in much of the park. And Central Park is full of squirrels.</p>

<p>In my attempt to stay healthy, I got another COVID booster this week. I also picked up a couple of pairs of trials for new contacts.</p>

<p>Kin continues to expand our record collection and stereo equipment. The sub-woofer he originally wanted was back-ordered, so he bought a different one — obviously without checking its dimensions. It's the size of a small refrigerator. Our downstairs neighbors must love us. We went record shopping yesterday, and I found Alice Cooper's <em>Greatest Hits</em>, which was one of my favorite records as a kid.</p>

<p>In other listening news: we're still listening to the audiobook of <em>Blood in the Machine</em>. I finished reading <em>Your Body is Not an Apology</em> and <em>The Meth Lunches</em>. I need to write a review of the latter for <em>Second Breakfast</em>. It was just phenomenally good. I also listened to the <em>Maintenance Phase</em> episode on Ozempic during my run on Saturday and to <em>Nobody Asked Us</em> (with Kara Goucher and Des Linden) on my run on Sunday. I started reading <em>Older Faster Stronger</em>.</p>

<p>On Friday night, Kin and I met our friends Gary and Sylvia at Birdland where we saw Ron Carter Big Band. Goddamn, Ron Carter is <a href="https://www.roncarteruniverse.com">amazing</a> — 87 years old, still pounding on the double bass. We haven't seen Gary and Sylvia in a long, long time — since we left LA, perhaps. So that was great (even if the food at Birdland is pretty mediocre).</p>

<p>Elsewhere in food, this week I made a Greek yogurt cake with jam — a recipe by Julia Turshen, as well as jalapeno popper chicken, also one of her recipes; a &quot;quick banh mi&quot; (with ciabatta from Amy’s Bread); a peanut butter chocolate cake; arroz con gandules; and pancakes and fruit salad for dinner Saturday night. </p>

<p>We ate slices at Corner Slice. (Overrated.) Kin got bagels at Absolute again. (He wanted one dozen sesame, with the 13th an onion; instead he came home with 12 onion and 1 sesame. Oops) We ate at Nowon last night and their burger is definitely not overrated. Damn it was stellar. We popped into the local Oasis Cafe around the corner for dessert — we love that you can buy &quot;minis&quot; of all the pastries. Because sometimes you don't actually want much more than a bite or two of sweet to round off a meal.</p>

<p>Over on <em>Second Breakfast</em>, I wrote a recipe for sourdough granola as well as the usual &quot;what's good&quot; round-up of news, and I launched the podcast. I am planning on one episode a month, interviewing folks on their personal experiences with food and fitness technologies, with movement and &quot;monitoring&quot; health.</p>

<p>When we were in the East Village yesterday, we stopped by the new memorial to the women who died during the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. I think it's official unveiling is sometime this week, as it's still surrounded by chainlink fence. But it looks to be quite stunning — the sun will cast their names in shadows on the pavement where they jumped to their death.</p>

<p>We are really trying to make the weekends full of exploration and adventure, visiting parts of the city we don't know well. The East Village was definitely that. </p>
