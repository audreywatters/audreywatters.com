<p>I haven't written one of these in a while. I've been in a pretty dark place, I won't lie. The global pandemic hasn't helped. Like. At all. But things are sunnier now â€” literally, as we moved from Seattle to Oakland a couple of weeks ago. I'm trying to re-establish old routines and kickstart some new ones.</p>

<h3><em>Teaching Machines</em> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/template_teachingmachine.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>This was really not the time to try to reach people to secure permissions, but I managed to do so. Slowly. The book is now in the hands of the production team at MIT Press. Publication date: 2021</p>

<h3>Hack Education <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_pigeon.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>

<h3>Other Writing <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_pen.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p><a href="https://hewn.substack.com/p/hewn-no-346">HEWN, No. 346</a> via substack.com (and since I last published this weekly round-up, <a href="https://hewn.substack.com/p/hewn-no-345">No. 345</a>)</p>

<h3>Speaking <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_mic.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I've been doing quite a bit of speaking, although this was the first paid gig in a while. Thank God. And I have quite a few gigs coming up. They're mostly unpaid, but I volunteered to be a guest speaker in classes, and I think it's the least I can do right now to help support educators.</p>

<h3>Traveling <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_travel.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>This past week: LOL, what? Upcoming week: Haha. We're all at home. </p>

<h3>Reading and Viewing and Listening <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_bookmark.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I've missed out on tracking a lot of this, although I really haven't been reading much until recently. I finished the latest John Scalzi novel and the latest N. K. Jemisin one. I'm reading quite a bit for new writing and speaking projects too. As far as listening: the new Fiona Apple album is amazing. As far as viewing: ugh, I've been watching too much TV, most of it quite unremarkable. We did watch the Beastie Boys documentary twice this week, because apparently I need to ugly-cry regularly. </p>
