<p>Just a quick update to knock this item off my To Do list. This week, I:</p>

<ul>
<li>ran 10 miles — the farthest I've ever run — by myself, to boot</li>
<li>took our first RV trip of 2023 — to Rio Vista, which I didn't think would be that amazing since it's less than an hour from Oakland, but was actually pretty damn lovely</li>
<li>ate donuts twice — once at Happy Donuts and once at Rio Vista Bakery. The latter didn't have any apple fritters in the display case, but went in the back and fried one on the spot for Kin. So it was hot but very very greasy. Happy Donuts still has the best apple fritters</li>
</ul>
