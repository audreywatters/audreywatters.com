<p>Well, here we are in New York. Today is Kin's first day at work. New schedule, new routine, new city. It's a lot.</p>

<p>This past week was a whirlwind: a final day and a half in Maine. Lobster for dinner. Two whoopee pies. Then on to Portsmouth NH for a night — it's just slightly too far to drive from Blue Hill to NYC in a day. We had hotel room service, which was fine. Then we stayed in another hotel here in Midtown, as the apartment was still empty. That night, we got take-out from Chirp, a nearby Peruvian restaurant — so let the excellent eating in NYC begin. (It was far more excellent having stopped somewhere in Connecticut for fast food on the way south. The Whopper Jr, for the record, is fucking terrible.)</p>

<p>We walked in the heat and humidity to the apartment on Thursday morning, stopping at Liberty Bagels — a bagel and cream cheese for Kin and a SEC on a roll for me. The bagel was underwhelming.</p>

<p>The movers came — overwhelming. We got takeout again that night from the nearby Greek Kitchen. And takeout the next night from Il Baretto ToGo — &quot;grandma&quot; style pizza. It was great.</p>

<p>And now it's back to my cooking, even though <a href="https://2ndbreakfast.substack.com/p/the-efficiency-kitchen">as I noted in a Second Breakfast essay</a>, the kitchen is very small. Well, not entirely back to my cooking — we had bagels delivered on Saturday morning. Ess-a-Bagel, unlike Liberty Bagel, totally lived up to the hype.</p>

<p>I've now run in NYC three times: twice along the Hudson and once, the loop around Central Park. It is incredibly hot and humid, and the running has, quite frankly, sucked. I am pretty nervous about my fall half marathon, as I feel like my fitness has gone to hell.</p>

<p>There's a lot to adjust to — not just the weather. Folks say you'll adapt. This morning is the real beginning of that: trying to get some work done before walking Kin to work. I'm excited to start this new life.</p>
