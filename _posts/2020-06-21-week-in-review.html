<p>It's been a month since I've written one of these. It's been a little over a month since I lost my son. I've been overwhelmed by the love and support from everyone, and on my To Do list for this week is to send out a bunch of Thank You's.</p>

<p>Nothing to report here. The manuscript is in the editor's hands.</p>

<p>I've given keynotes at ICLS and ATI. I cannot believe I wrote two keynotes while grieving. I don't know how they did it, and they really aren't my best work, so I'm pretty thankful that the conference organizers have been understanding.</p>
