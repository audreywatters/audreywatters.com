<p>My niece and nephew were visiting this week, so I did a lot of Seattle sight-seeing. We went to the Space Needle and the Chihuly Glass Gardens. We went to Pike Place Market. We saw the Mariners lose to the Indians. We went to the aquarium. We went whale watching (and saw four grey whales). We ate a lot of sushi.</p>
