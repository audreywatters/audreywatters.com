<p>I ran a bunch of errands this week: I got my library card. I had a bra fitting (for the first time in my life, and holy shit, I have been wearing the wrong bra size). I started working on some website modifications &#8211; code for &#8220;procrastination.&#8221;</p>

<p>This past week: Kin and I spent the weekend in Victoria, BC. Upcoming week: Home. At my computer. Finishing my book.</p>

<h3>Reading <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_bookmark.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I spent the weekend reading Tim Maughan&#8217;s <em>Infinite Detail</em> and I love it so much. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had a friend before who was a novelist, who I could recognize in their fiction. Read this book, people. Read this book.</p>
