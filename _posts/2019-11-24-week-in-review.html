<p>I've finished my talk and my slides for OEB next week. I've been having some trouble with some of the apps I use syncing between my MacBook and my iPad -- I use the latter for my notes when I give a talk. It's annoying, and I have to resolve things before I stand up on stand next week.</p>

<p>I had the impeachment hearings on in the background. I watched the debates -- ugh. We're watching <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <em>His Dark Materials</em> and <em>The Watchmen</em> -- good TV right now, for sure.</p>
