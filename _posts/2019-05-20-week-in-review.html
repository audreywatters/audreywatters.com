<p>Yes. This is a day late. Whatever. I&#8217;m busy.</p>

<h3><em>Teaching Machines</em> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/template_teachingmachine.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I have not completed more chapters, as much of the week was spent in Santa Barbara. The talk that I gave there &#8211; something I&#8217;d hoped would be part of the conclusion &#8211; still needs work to become the final chapter. 11 days left in the month. 2 chapters left to go. I got this.</p>

<br />
<p>I gave a keynote at the Disquantified conference: &#8220;The Cybernetic University and the Teaching Machine.&#8221; It was truly one of the best events I&#8217;ve been to in a long while &#8211; the presentations were great; the people were wonderful (and I got to hang out offline with some folks who&#8217;ve been online friends for a long time).</p>

<br />
<p>This past week: Santa Barbara. Upcoming week: Mostly Seattle, until Friday, when we head to PDX.</p>

<h3>Reading and Viewing <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_bookmark.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I started skimming <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em>. Good grief, I don&#8217;t have time for the whole book right now. But I wanted to at least see what she had to say about Skinner.</p>

<p>We watched the last <em>Game of Thrones</em> episode last night. Good grief, that was terrible. </p>
