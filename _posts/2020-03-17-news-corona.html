<p>Not surprisingly, I'm doing a lot of media about how schools are making the shift online (or not) during this pandemic. Last week, I was <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/can-online-learning-go-the-distance">on KUOW's The Record</a>. And <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/the-coronavirus-is-forcing-many-colleges-to-go-online-only-but-will-it-work-for-everyone/">I talked to The Seattle Times' Katherine Long</a> as well.
