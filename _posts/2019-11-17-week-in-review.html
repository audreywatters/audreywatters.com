<p>No updates, although I&#8217;m starting to think about what I&#8217;ll do with my writing there. I will probably relaunch the site in the new year with more frequently commentary. But we shall see.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if this counts as &#8220;work&#8221; or not, but I did sign a bunch of paperwork to sell property that my brother and I inherited in Texas. It&#8217;s a long story, and a good one. I&#8217;ll write it out later. And I&#8217;m trying to sell some property in Wyoming too. That story is much less exciting. I also had two calls with folks regarding speaking engagements: one in preparation for my appearance at OEB and one about a possible talk at National University.</p>

<p>Kin&#8217;s daughter was here for the holiday weekend, as were our friends the Bebells &#8211; we had dinner with them on Sunday. Kin&#8217;s brother and sister-in-law are here this weekend &#8211; we had dinner with them on Friday. Same location both times. We need to get out of a dining rut, I think.</p>
