<p>I've been in the media a few more times in the past week to talk about the "pivot to digital" (or not). I was on WBAI's "<a href="https://talk-out-of-school.simplecast.com/episodes/nyc-public-education-covid-19-funding-next-steps-and-the-risks-of-online-learning">Talk out of School</a>" show with Leonie Haimson. I was asked by Inside Higher Ed to contribute <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2020/03/18/most-teaching-going-remote-will-help-or-hurt-online-learning">some thoughts</a> on what this all meant for the future of online education. I get Google Alerts that some of my writing is cited in other publications (e.g. <a href="https://progressive.org/public-school-shakedown/edtech-industry-profit-from-covid-19-lahm-200323/">The Progressive</a>).
