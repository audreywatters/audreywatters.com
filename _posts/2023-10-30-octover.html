<p>I can't believe how quickly this month has flown by. We've almost been in NYC four months now. Wild.</p>

<p>In some ways, we're mostly settled. Oh sure, we're still dealing with the bureaucracies that make things like getting car insurance and getting the car licensed an absolute pain-in-the-ass. (We did manage to get the RV trailer licensed and took a quick trip to NJ on Saturday to screw the plate on and cover the trailer for the winter.) But I still have quite a long task list of move-related items: get a dentist, find a therapist, buy some sort of bed for the office (Kaia will be here for Xmas), frame artwork, buy a bike.</p>

<p>The latter is becoming necessary as I've reached the breaking point with Citibike. Although Wednesday's rides were both flawless — the first bike I chose worked, the docking stations worked — on Friday, nothing worked: it took multiple tries to find a bike that'd work and when I went to return it, I couldn't get it to registered that it had docked and locked. I had to get ahold of Citibike customer service to stop the app from telling me I'd owe them $1200 if I didn't return the bike.</p>

<p>It was truly &quot;one of those weeks&quot; when it came to customer service. I have had to battle Geico, Allstate, Adidas, Ruffwear, and Nike. (The latter was actually a great experience. The rest pretty much sucked.) Like I always say: it's not that AI is getting better; we're just asking people to become more robotic. Nothing shows that better than customer service.</p>

<p>I received an IndieGoGo product from a campaign I supported last year — an ice cream maker. It doesn't work either. Now I have to deal with getting a refund on that too. Ugh. </p>

<p>I also bought a Roomba. In this case, we are cheering for the robots. Please help me handle all the dog hair.</p>

<p>Our friends Jen and Jeff were in town on Monday; we met them for drinks at Dear Irving on the Hudson before they went to an event with Jose Andrés and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Nice rooftop bar with a view. I think we need to just get some liquor in our apartment as the view is comparable.</p>

<p>We stopped at Pizza Shack on the way home. It was disappointing. Some folks say that the best slice/BEC is the one from the bodega/pizza shop nearest your apartment. Perhaps the most convenient. </p>

<p>In other food news: I made peanut butter sweet potato brownies, &quot;superhero muffins,&quot; and black-bottom maple pecan bars (although I didn't have pecans so made it with almonds. And I bought half-and-half instead of cream — I guess it's good the ice cream maker didn't work — so the bars didn't turn out nearly as good as normal). I made baked rice with beans and leeks and lemon — a solid recipe from The NYT Cooking. I made ham and scalloped potatoes that lasted days and days, the former finally becoming a quiche. We ate out at Cafe Sabarsky yesterday. It was very good — Kin had bratwurst, and I had smoked trout crepes. We ordered two desserts, and we regretted not getting the chocolate cake (and the weinerschnitzel) that the table next to us had.</p>

<p>Yesterday's outing was to the Upper East Side — to the Guggenheim with a stop into a B&amp;N where Kin bought more records.</p>

<p>In reading news: we finished <em>Blood in the Machine</em> and started <em>No Meat Required</em>. I'm also reading <em>Vagina Obscura</em>. On my runs I listened to the <em>Barbell Medicine</em> podcast, Coach Bennett's podcast (on how to set up a training week), and the <em>Ali on the Run</em> podcast about the NYC Marathon.</p>

<p>Speaking of running, my friend Paul was in town from Oakland, visiting his son who's a freshman at NYU. He's in the middle of marathon training, but I ran 5 miles of his (18!) mile long run with him on Sunday. I have a race on Saturday — my first 5K of the year — and then I'm volunteering at the NYC Marathon on Sunday. </p>

<p>I'm trying to do more yoga, as I feel like I need more mobility work. I did 10 minutes after my runs this week. I also lifted, which went well on Wednesday but really sucked on Friday. Swimming wasn't that great on Friday either. I'm not sure why I'm so slow.</p>

<p>I started taking more continuing education courses — this time, it's Stacy Sims' course on menopausal athletes.</p>

<p>And I am absolutely broken-hearted about Matthew Perry, which actually means I'm absolutely broken-hearted about Isaiah, truth be told. I've never watched Friends. (Funnily, it was something that Isaiah would watch.) But addiction — god, what a beast. I've had Perry's memoir on my To Read list for a while, and I'll probably pick it up. I was going to do the audiobook, but now I don't know if I can listen to a ghost narrate it. Things seem very hard all around right now. Check in with the ones you know tend to struggle. No one is doing okay.</p>
