<p>I can't believe it's already the end of July. One month ago, we were celebrating my nephew's birthday in Maine. Where does time go?!</p>

<p>This past week was another whirlwind — a whirlwind of writing and bad weather. </p>

<p><strong>Running</strong>: Due to the heat, I did three of my four runs on the treadmill. By Sunday, however, the humidity had dissipated and the temperature dropped, and I had a glorious 9+ mile run around Central Park, with a bonus loop around the reservoir (which I hadn't done before) — this will probably be my &quot;usual&quot; long run route, unless I'm doing more mileage. So I guess I'll get used to those hills soon?</p>

<p><strong>Lifting</strong>: I'm still really uninspired in the gym — some of it's the gym itself, which is certainly not very old-lady-lifting friendly. There are no micro-plates, for example — that is, the 1-2 pound plates that make it easier to progress on my upper body lifts. I'd also been experimenting with a new lifting program — an online app designed by an &quot;influencer.&quot; It was way too much; the app too involved, too confusing. (I keep trying these new things for <em>Second Breakfast</em>, but I'm not sure I'm so good at reviewing because sometimes it's not that &quot;the thing&quot; isn't great; it's just not right for me and the headspace I'm in right now.)</p>

<p><strong>Swimming</strong>: I only swam once, which I think is going to how I'm going to keep my schedule until I shift towards triathlon training more specifically. It was also annoying, but I think I'm just annoyed by the time I'm done with lifting, and I carry that into the pool. Also I don't love &quot;circle swimming&quot; — I lose count of my laps very quickly and then am a little bummed when I haven't even done 1000 yards.</p>

<p><strong>Cycling</strong>: I rode the bike to and from the gym twice — even in the awful head. And on Saturday, I bought a bike helmet.</p>

<p><strong>Eating</strong>: I bought a brioche sandwich loaf from Amy's Bread. We got croissants (well, one croissant and one pain au chocolat) from Sullivan Street Bakery. We ordered bagels (again) from Ess-a-bagel — with a bonus cinnamon babka. We ate out Saturday night — sans Poppy — at Sesame, a neighborhood Asian-Italian fusion joint. It was less Asian than it could have been, flavor-wise. I ordered the chicken parm — the chicken was Korean fried chicken and the crisp on it was phenomenal. Also amazing: the dessert, which was a katsu chocolate bread — so, like a breaded, deep fried brownie.</p>

<p><strong>Writing</strong>: I had the most amazing week with <em>Second Breakfast</em>, as my friend (and famous writer) Austin Kleon recommended the newsletter to his newsletters' readers. I doubled the number of subscribers! Holy shit! So I've far exceeded my goals for 2023 for the project. Pretty exciting. Also pretty scary to have to keep it up.</p>

<p><strong>Mourning</strong>: Sinéad. Goddammit.</p>
