<p>After living in New York for four months, we finally had our first celebrity sighting on Monday: Marcus Brigstocke and Rachel Parris at Senza Gluten. Okay, okay — we invited them, and their dear little boy, for dinner. (It was nice to be able to go to a gluten-free restaurant too.) It was my first time meeting Rachel, and it was great to catch up as I hadn't seen Marcus since the &quot;before times.&quot;</p>

<p>In other dining news, we had baked goods from Amy's Bread, Absolute Bagel, Lee Lee's Baked Goods, and Dunkin — the latter was terrible. The others were all stellar, and Lee Lee's Baked Goods has the best rugelach I've ever tasted. We also grabbed burgers at Harlem Shake — best shake? And a hot dog at Gray's Papaya.</p>

<p>I'm still working my way through the CSA from Thanksgiving, and I made cranberry lemon bars; roasted turnip and white bean soup; chicken with sweet potatoes and peanut ginger sauce; cornish pasties; and cornish pasties with sausage and kale white sauce.</p>

<p>The highlights of the week in terms of my training included a low — my first crash on the bike and a high — a PR in the 15K at the Ted Corbitt race on Saturday.</p>

<p>Kin and I went to the New York Historical Society yesterday to see the exhibit about Corbitt. We also enjoyed the exhibit with some of Robert Caro's memorabilia, as well as the most amazing collection of Tiffany Lamps.</p>

<p>I had a virtual appointment with the doctor to talk about my iron deficiency. We're just going to keep an eye on things and hope that the numbers continue to improve. It's funny how all the technology/tracking that's offered to consumers — things I write about on Second Breakfast — make us feel as though &quot;something must be done,&quot; when in fact your doctor might just say &quot;meh, let's just wait and see.&quot;</p>

<p>A rushed post today as I have an incredible amount of work to do to get my Year in Review essays out the door for Second Breakfast. It's almost noon and I have just sat down to work. Yikes.</p>
