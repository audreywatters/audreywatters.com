<p>I received the peer reviews for <em>Teaching Machines</em> this week, so the next task is to think about their suggestions and finalize the manuscript. Ideally, I’ll have this done by early January.</p>

<p>I’m working on the end-of-the-year and end-of-the-decade articles for Hack Education. The former should be published tomorrow; the latter, the 30th or so.</p>

<p>Kin and I saw the new Star Wars movie: <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>. I don’t know. It was a mess, but I find it hard to have much critical distance from the franchise when I’m sitting in the theater and suddenly six again and seeing the original for the very first time. I really miss Carrie Fisher, man. I really really miss her.</p>

<p>Kin and I are also watching <em>The Expanse</em> (we’re on the first season), <em>The Mandalorian</em>, <em>His Dark Materials</em>, <em>The Watchmen</em>, and Ken Burns’ documentary series on country music.</p>
