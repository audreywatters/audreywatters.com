<p>The moving adventure continues. Let's see…</p>

<p>We were in Dubois PA for a night (and I ran in the morning). We were in a hotel in Parsippany-Troy Hills NJ for two nights (and I ran one morning). That stop allowed us to unhitch the trailer and drive into the city to pick up the apartment key (and drop off a few things). Then we drove north to North Hampton NH (with the trailer) and stayed a night. I didn't plan to run, but there was a donut shop across the street so I put on my running shoes to go the third of a mile to get some on the morning we left. From there we drove to Blue Hill ME where we've been since midday Friday (and I've run twice).</p>

<p>Saturday was my nephew's 17th birthday and we held a joint part for him and my mom, who turns 80 later this month. We'd initially planned a family excursion to Zion, but what with the move, we had to cancel that.</p>

<p>Food highlights include the charcuterie boards that my niece made for the party (she had me make the salami roses); the porky fig toast at Throwback Brewery in NH; and the lobster roll at the Bagaduce Lunch.</p>

<p>Other random updates: I've started taking the &quot;Running Resiliency&quot; course from Greg Lehman (although I haven't touched the materials since I got to Maine); I have absolutely no idea what day of the week it is most of the time — that's good and bad (I posted this past week's <a href="https://2ndbreakfast.substack.com/p/whats-good-d65">Second Breakfast essay</a> a day early); I realized that I need to get a different GPS app for when we're pulling the RV here in New England as there are a helluva lot of low bridges and Ye Olde Google Maps does not help you navigate such things. And finally: according to my Garmin Watch, my HRV is very low and my body is &quot;strained.&quot; Um, yeah. </p>

<p>This week is finally move-in week, but not 'til Thursday. So the strain will not be gone anytime soon.</p>
